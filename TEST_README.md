# TEST_README.md

## Project Overview

This project is a test suite for a game logic module, written in Python. The test cases are designed to validate the correct generation, hiding, and tracking of squares and clicks in the game. The game logic is tested using the `unittest` framework, which is a built-in Python module for creating and running test cases.

## Resources Used

The following Python libraries and modules are used in this project:

- `unittest`: A built-in Python module for creating and running test cases. It provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests, and can be used to test any Python code.
- `pygame`: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries.
- `sys`: A module that provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
- `random`: A module for generating random numbers.
- `time`: A module providing various time-related functions.

The `unittest` module is used for creating and running the test cases, `pygame` is used for the game logic, `sys` is used for accessing system-specific parameters and functions, `random` is used for generating random numbers for the game logic, and `time` is used for timing the execution of the game logic.

## Justification for the Use of Resources

The `unittest` module is chosen for creating and running the test cases because it is a built-in Python module that provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. It is widely used in the Python community and is well-documented, making it a reliable choice for testing Python code.

The `pygame` module is chosen for the game logic because it is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides the necessary tools for creating a game, including graphics and sound libraries. It is a popular choice for game development in Python and is well-documented, making it a reliable choice for implementing the game logic.

The `sys` module is chosen for accessing system-specific parameters and functions because it provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is a built-in Python module and is well-documented, making it a reliable choice for accessing system-specific parameters and functions.

The `random` module is chosen for generating random numbers because it is a built-in Python module for generating random numbers. It is a reliable choice for generating random numbers for the game logic.

The `time` module is chosen for timing the execution of the game logic because it provides various time-related functions. It is a built-in Python module and is well-documented, making it a reliable choice for timing the execution of the game logic.

## Additional Information

The test suite is designed to be run from the command line using the `unittest` module. The command to run the test suite is `python -m unittest test_game_logic.py`, where `test_game_logic.py` is the name of the file containing the test suite.

The test suite includes three test cases:

- `test_square_generation`: This test case tests that squares are being generated correctly.
- `test_square_hiding`: This test case tests that squares are being hidden correctly.
- `test_click_and_correct_tracking`: This test case tests that clicks and corrects are being tracked correctly.

Each test case uses the `assertEqual` method from the `unittest` module to check that the actual output matches the expected output.

The test suite also includes a `setUp` method and a `tearDown` method. The `setUp` method is run before each test case and is used to set up the test environment. The `tearDown` method is run after each test case and is used to clean up the test environment.
